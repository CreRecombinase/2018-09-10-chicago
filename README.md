# SWC Intro to R programming workshop templtae

## How to create a new website

First copy the repo by clicking `Use this template` (big green button)
and name the repo something like `2019-01-12-chicago`

Next change the info in `index.html` to match the info for the workshop

There is also a `docx` of a flyer in `flyer` that you can use (you'll want to change out the date and the `bit.ly` link

## Things you'll want to update in the `index.html`

+ Dates
+ link to pre-workshop survey
+ link to post-workshop survey
+ Name of helpers
+ Links to curriculum (if you're changing any of it)

Note that you have to `git push origin gh-pages` not `git push origin master`
